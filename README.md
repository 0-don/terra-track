TerraTrack is a comprehensive world port scanner database. We gather, aggregate, and provide details on open ports, services, countries, and much more. With TerraTrack, users can obtain insights into the global distribution of open ports and services, aiding in threat intelligence, research, and network monitoring.

## Features:

- **Port Information**: Discover which ports are most commonly open worldwide.
- **Service Mapping**: Understand which services are running on specific ports.
- **Geographical Distribution**: Determine where specific ports and services are most commonly located.
- **Regular Updates**: Our database is updated regularly to offer the most current snapshot of the internet.

## Installation:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/don-cryptus/terra-track.git
cd terra-track
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage:

```
python terratrack.py --port 80 --country US
```

This command will display all open instances of port 80 in the US.
